study app taken from the book: Angular Projects: Build modern web apps by exploring Angular 12 with 10 different projects and cutting-edge technologies

"In this project, we will build an Angular enterprise application for managing POI visits on a map. The application will consist of two portals where one will allow a visitor to select a POI from a list and view its location on a map. Another portal will allow an administrator to view the traffic of each POI. First, we will build an Angular application from scratch using Nx Dev Tools. We will then create the skeleton of each portal by adding the essential components of our application. After we have scaffolded our application, we will start adding the functionality of the visitor portal using NgRx. Finally, we will implement the administrator portal and learn how to use an Angular library for visualizing data in a graph."

Instead of using Angular v12, I prefered using angular v13 since it was the latest one for Nx support.
